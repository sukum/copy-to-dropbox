Copy uploads to Dropbox

Uploads made to SugarCRM Notes and Documents are also uploaded to one authorized Dropbox account.

After installation authorize Dropbox to use this application by going to the Administration page and clicking "Authorize Dropbox account". You will be redirected to Dropbox where you have to login and authorize this application. After authorization for any file uploaded to Notes or Documents, a copy will be uploaded to the authorized Dropbox account.

Only after the record has been saved and the uploaded file saved in SugarCRM will the upload to Dropbox be done. It will be done transparently using the after save logic hook.

'curl' extension is required for this module to work.
